## Installation
You can easily create symlinks from this folder by running the install file by going into the directory and running 
```
./install
```
Then set colors and wallpaper with [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)
```
wal -i 'azur.jpg'
```

polybar config is a variation of polybar 4 from [here](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes/tree/master/polybar-4)
This configuration uses the 'cyan' light color scheme
